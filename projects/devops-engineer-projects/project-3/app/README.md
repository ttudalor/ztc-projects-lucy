# Project 3: Kubernetes Deployment and Autoscaling

In this project, you will deploy a containerized application on
Amazon EKS and configure Kubernetes autoscaling.

## What you’ll learn
- Containerizing applications for Kubernetes
- Deploying apps on Amazon EKS
- Kubernetes Services and Deployments
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

## Application
The `app/` folder contains a demo service used to:
- Verify deployments
- Observe pod identity
- Trigger autoscaling via CPU load

You will deploy this app step by step in the upcoming sections.
